# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivank Anchal
## 🧠 About Me

I enjoy working close to the metal—where bytes move, protocols breathe, and systems interact without ceremony.
Mostly hacking on Rust, async runtimes, and peer-to-peer architectures.
Mentor at [Xoriors Rust Course](https://github.com/xoriors/course-rust), and contributor to open-source projects involving decentralized infrastructure and protocols.
